- **Connection String**: Configured simple SQLite connection string: `Data Source=crm.db`

### Database Tables:
- `Users` - Authentication and user management
- `Agents` - Agent information and profiles
- `Customers` - Customer records and contact information
- `Timesheets` - Timesheet records with approval workflow
- `TimeEntries` - Individual time entry records
- `AuditLogs` - System audit trail for security and compliance

- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented through Entity Framework DbContext for data access
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Configured custom middleware for authentication and error handling
- **Configuration Management**: Used `appsettings.json` for environment-specific settings

### Key Services:
- `AuditService` - Tracks all system changes and user actions
- `PasswordService` - Handles password hashing and validation
- `RateLimitService` - Manages login attempt rate limiting
- `EmailService` - Handles email notifications and verification
